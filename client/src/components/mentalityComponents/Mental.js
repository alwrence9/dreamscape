        <h4> Mental Health </h4>
        <p>Comprehensive Assessment and Diagnosis. Seasons likes to take time in ensuring your <br></br>
          diagnosis is accurate. Our Medical Doctors and Clinical Psychologists work very closely <br></br> 
          together and rely on spending as much time as necessary in order to fully understand you, <br></br> 
          your symptoms, and how your mental illness has impacted your life. Medication Management <br></br>
          and Alternative Medicine. Seasons understands that not every client is going to feel motivated <br></br> 
          to participate in traditional western medicine. Although the research provides significant evidence <br></br> 
          to support the proper use of psychotropic medications, we offer a variety of non-medical interventions <br></br>
          and solutions that promote symptom management. Some examples include holistic interventions such as: <br></br>
          Acupuncture, Mindfulness, Yoga and Nutrition Plans for Mood Management. <br></br>
          Many facilities say they offer individualized plans for your treatment, but none actually increase the <br></br> 
          volume of individualized care. Seasons offers you up to 54 hours of one-on-one sessions, including <br></br>
          cutting-edge modalities, while in treatment with a variety of Doctors, Psychologists and holistic <br></br>
          practitioners. Sessions will include: Doctoral Level Primary Therapy, Masters Level Case Management and Psychiatry.<br></br>
          Treating the Whole System. Seasons is interested in creating a shift for the whole system, not just the individual.<br></br> 
          Mental health does impact those around us and by offering ways to reach them, educate and work with them personally,<br></br>
          offering resources and support, the client can feel a much greater sense of relief returning back into their environment.<br></br>
          Evidence Based and Cutting Edge Interventions. Seasons is focused on your success. We utilize only the latest in mental <br></br>
          health intervention strategies that have proven outcomes. Some of these strategies may include: EMDR, Brainspotting, DBT, <br></br>
          EFT, Social Skills Training, Somatic Therapies and CBT.<br></br>
          Systemic Family Treatment. Seasons believes the family system supporting the client, during their time in residence, <br></br>
          is a critical component for overall healing. Our dedicated and compassionate staff make it a priority to include a <br></br>
          clientâ€™s family in treatment. Often times loved ones can feel lost, angry and resentful during this process, <br></br> 
          creating greater difficulty for the client to feel understood. By ensuring a foundation in family programming, <br></br>
          Seasons in Malibu Mental Health is committed to providing the greatest opportunity for success.<br></br>
          Support and Aftercare. Your aftercare planning begins the moment you step through our doors. <br></br>
          Receiving mental health treatment while in residence at Seasons in Malibu Mental Health is the ideal foundation <br></br>
          for your long-term success. We work to ensure that upon your discharge, your success is continued by <br></br>
          continued interaction with our team of professionals, or by connecting you with elite professionals and <br></br>
          care providers that understand your specific needs wherever you live.
