SPD Bureau Research Teams have attempted to communicate with it, but concluded that it does not respond to any form of communication or external stimuli. This has led the science teams to believe that the specimen is completely disconnected from the physical world. The specimen primary mode of transportation can only be explained as teleportation. It remains entirely immobile and relocates itself only through humanoid-shaped objects. This discovery has allowed research teams to extend the length of its apparition by allowing it possess a mannequin. This is when the only picture of the specimen was taken by the SPD Bureau.'
