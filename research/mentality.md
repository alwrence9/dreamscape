Comprehensive Assessment and Diagnosis. Seasons likes to take time in ensuring your diagnosis is accurate. Our Medical Doctors and Clinical Psychologists work very closely together and rely on spending as much time as necessary in order to fully understand you, your symptoms, and how your mental illness has impacted your life.
Medication Management and Alternative Medicine. Seasons understands that not every client is going to feel motivated to participate in traditional western medicine. Although the research provides significant evidence to support the proper use of psychotropic medications, we offer a variety of non-medical interventions and solutions that promote symptom management. Some examples include holistic interventions such as: Acupuncture, Mindfulness, Yoga and Nutrition Plans for Mood Management.
Emphasis on Individual Treatment. Many facilities say they offer individualized plans for your treatment, but none actually increase the volume of individualized care. Seasons offers you up to 54 hours of one-on-one sessions, including cutting-edge modalities, while in treatment with a variety of Doctors, Psychologists and holistic practitioners. Sessions will include: Doctoral Level Primary Therapy, Masters Level Case Management and Psychiatry.
Treating the Whole System. Seasons is interested in creating a shift for the whole system, not just the individual. Mental health does impact those around us and by offering ways to reach them, educate and work with them personally, offering resources and support, the client can feel a much greater sense of relief returning back into their environment.
Evidence Based and Cutting Edge Interventions. Seasons is focused on your success. We utilize only the latest in mental health intervention strategies that have proven outcomes. Some of these strategies may include: EMDR, Brainspotting, DBT, EFT, Social Skills Training, Somatic Therapies and CBT.
Systemic Family Treatment. Seasons believes the family system supporting the client, during their time in residence, is a critical component for overall healing. Our dedicated and compassionate staff make it a priority to include a clientâ€™s family in treatment. Often times loved ones can feel lost, angry and resentful during this process, creating greater difficulty for the client to feel understood. By ensuring a foundation in family programming, Seasons in Malibu Mental Health is committed to providing the greatest opportunity for success.
Support and Aftercare. Your aftercare planning begins the moment you step through our doors. Receiving mental health treatment while in residence at Seasons in Malibu Mental Health is the ideal foundation for your long-term success. We work to ensure that upon your discharge, your success is continued by continued interaction with our team of professionals, or by connecting you with elite professionals and care providers that understand your specific needs wherever you live.
